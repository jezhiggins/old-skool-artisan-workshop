So, let's project back to 1984.  Miner's Strike. Libyan Embassy Siege.  The Austin Rover Montego!
John Lowe's 9 dart finish.  BT privatised.  Band Aid.  Heady times, heady times.
The GCSE is announced.

We were 14 and I was doing CSE Computer Studies.  In this modern age, we have GCSEs but back then there were O-levels,
CSEs, and (at least at my school) a firm handshake and pat on the shoulder.  The CSE was assessed on an exam and on
coursework (60% on exam, 40% course work I found out recently). I don't know the official syllabus, because I never
actually did any lessons. (Dad was a snob.)  But I passed the exam based on what I learned from reading Your Computer
magazine.  Binary and hex, history of computing, CPU architecture, everything.

The coursework was given to me by Mr Gladwin saying things like "write an educational program", "do something in CESIL",
and the one I remember most distinctly "work out the smallest number of notes and coins needed for an amount of money"

If you Google for this, you'll find a million implementations in different languages.

Truly, Mr Gladwin was ahead of his time!

Let's fire up the Amstrad and write some code!

It would get no marks.  Why?  Because it's written on an Amstrad, and Amstrads weren't approved

But if we put that aside, what would they think?  What would the 14 year old us think?

Would the 14 year old us have learned anything?
