Are you all familiar with the Dreyfus Model of skill aquisition?

The Dreyfus model of skill acquisition, which was first advance in 1980, is a model of how students
acquire skills through formal instruction and practicing.  You often see it illustrated with a
pyramid picture like this

The original model proposes that a student passes through five distinct stages: novice, competence,
proficiency, expertise, and mastery.  A novice, for instance, is characterised by "rigid adherence
to taught rules and plans", while someone who's competent can cope with multiple activities and has
perception of the their actions in relation to goals.  As you learn and improve, you move through
these phases in nice linear fashion until you achieve mastery and become an expert.  And being an
expert sounds pretty fantastic.

An expert

* transcends reliance on rules
* intuitive grasp of situations based on deep tacit knowledge
* has a vision of what is possible
* use analytical approaches in new situations

That's pretty amazing, right.  Transcends the rules. Intuites situations.

Are there any experts in this room? Are there any experts at this conference?

Let's just jump back to the definition: "a model of how students acquire skills through
formal instruction and practicing."

As young kids we had had no formal instruction and while we'd written lots of code (hundreds of lines
and I know it was hundreds because I had to number them all)
there's practice and there's practice.  You don't get better just by doing a thing over and over.

I didn't know that at the time.  Chris probably did, but I suspect he hadn't realised that applied
generally and not just to swimming an unusually long way in an surprisingly short time.

(Slightly awkwardly, there's often an associated learn - do - teach progression associated with the
stages...)

That said, over the past 25 years (nearly 35 years if we reach all the way back to my teenage self),
I have acquired the confidence to say ...

For, of course, some value of better.

Since the end of last summer I’ve been doing some work for my local fire service - feel free to make a joke
about fire fighting here.  While I do program, a very large part of my job is to kind of guide, and nudge,
and shepherd, and generally hang around being someone with miles on the clock.

While it isn't the first time I've had that kind of job, it's the first time I've been explicitly hired to do
that and it’s the first time I’ve been aware of being the oldest person in the room - and
by quite some distance. The next oldest is Tim, who’s probably 10 years younger than me, then down through
Liliana, Jas, Martina, to Aron, Meena, and Reece who are fresh faced young things not long out of university.

It would be very easy, when someone encounters a problem or asks how to do something to simply say “do this” or to
take the keyboard and “let’s just have a look, hmmm, [DELETE DELETE DELETE TYPEY TYPEY TYPEY], ok there you go”.
It would also be very lazy and, even, I would say unethical. Who benefits from an encounter like this? Certainly
not them, but not me either.

While we can read as many “13 ways to improve your programming (number 8 will astound you)*” listicles as well like, t
these bland statements of authority do nothing to actually teach. They don’t improve the world.

What’s a pattern?  A pattern is a solution to a problem in a context.

If I don’t help my colleagues understand the context of the problem we’re looking at, and how that informs the
suggestions that I’m making, I’d suggest I’m being actively harmful and should be ejected from the building.

However, the advice I’m giving now probably isn’t the advice I’d give this time next year, and isn’t the advice
I’d have given this time last year, or ten years ago, and it certainly isn’t the suggestions I’d make 20 years ago.

With your indulgence, and we’ll try not to be too old-programmer-war-storyish, to perform a kind of joint career
retrospective, which we'd like you to join in with too if you'd like to, then try to project that back in time to our
14 year old selves and repeat an exercise I was given as a piece of Computer Science CSE course work.
