What is portability?

Back in the mid-80s portability meant a computer you could carry.  Here's a groovy frood having the time
of his life just rocking along with his 12 kilos and $2500 worth of raw computing power.  (That's over $6000
dollars now, 12 kilos is still 12 kilos. This Mac Book Pro, $1300 and about a kilo and a half, before we even
touch the diffence in the rest of the spec.)

(Osborne Executive had no battery! Z80 @ 4Mhz (fast!), 124 kB RAM, 2 x 5 1/4 disks, ran CP/M. 7inch display - bigger
than a phone!)
