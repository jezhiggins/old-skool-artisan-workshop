In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.

You've heard this one before right?  (I'm also guessing you didn't know the attribution -
although you sometimes see Yogi Berra's name attached.  van de Snepscheut was, by all accounts
including Dijkstra's, a remarkable computer scientist but I suspect the reason he isn't better known
is because he tried to murder his wife with an ace, after which he set his house on fire and
died in the ensuing blaze.)

Anyway ...

### To Summarise

[quote, Kernighan and Pike]
""
What makes [UNIX] effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the
computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence, at its heart
is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs
than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation,
but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.

"Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no
 single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach
 to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can't be written
 down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more
 from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs
 do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and
 useful tools."


This is from the preface to The UNIX Programming Environment, published in 1984.
"A philosophy of using the computer" is an interesting phrase.  I certainly didn't have a
philosophy of using a computer in 1984.

Like many things in programming this idea is fractal in nature - it applies at all levels. One
thing well applies to programs, to classes, to functions, to statements. By working smaller,
I make the whole better.

Programming is a many faceted thing and, as our discussion has probably shown, they different
facets all play into together to form the whole.

"EVERYTHING IS DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED. In an important sense there are no "subjects" at all;
there is only all knowledge, since the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this
world simply cannot be divided up neatly."

I'm not sure what my younger self would have made of all this.  Perhaps if I'd read it in a
magazine, I might have taken some of it on board, so long as I didn't know that the bloke who
said it was 'old'.
