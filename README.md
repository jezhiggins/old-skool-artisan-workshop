### Chris and Jez's Old Skool Artisan Software Workshop
#### Chris Oldwood, Jez Higgins

Chris and Jez are old and have been programming a long time.  You can tell they're old by their grey hair and unfamiliarity with the works of Camila Cabello, and you can tell they've programming a long time by their insistence on proper clicky keyboards and the battered copies of Stevens propping up their monitors.

But once they were young!

Before they were programmers they were hobbists, spending hours, nay days, nay nights and days, cranking out game after game written in screen after screen of Basic (Locomotive and Sinclair respectively).

Can they take their combined 50 years of software development experience and project it back to 1984? Can they apply test driven development, source code control, and continuous integration to the programming environments of their youth?

Join Chris and Jez as, armed with an Amstrad CPC 464 and a cassette recorder, they attempt to find out.

To build the slides,

```sh
./gradlew asciidoctor
```

The slides use reveal.js, and include speaker notes.  Other backends are available, but probably will come out looking awful.
